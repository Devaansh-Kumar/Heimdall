# Heimdall

Heimdall is an open source eBPF-powered security framework that dynamically enforces container-specific policies, providing fine-grained control over system calls, file system access, and privilege escalation attempts in Docker containers.

## Features
 - Syscall Filtering: Block specific syscalls to prevent malicious actions.
 - Filesystem Access Control: Restrict access to sensitive directories and files.
 - Privilege Escalation Prevention: Block attempts to escalate privileges within containers.
 - Per-Container Policies: Define and enforce unique security policies for each container.
 - Real-Time Policy Updates: Dynamically update policies without restarting containers.
